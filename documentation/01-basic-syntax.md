### 01. DISTINCT

- To understand the range of values in a **column**
- The DISTINCT eliminate duplicates and shoes only uniques values. 

- With date or numbers, DISTINCT helps to highligh inconsistent or broken formatting. 

- DISTINCT can work one or more than one column at at time ( The return the each unique par for teh vales)


### 02. ORDER BY

- By default, ORDER BY sorts values in ascending order, but we can sort otherwise using **DESC** words

- Sorting a column with **letters or other characters** may return surprising results, especially if it has a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters, punctuation, or numbers that are treated as text 

- You can sort more than one column  e.g [ORDER BY school ASC, hire_date DESC;]
